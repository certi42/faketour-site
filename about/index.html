            <h1>About the Faketour</h1>
            <h2>What is a Faketour?</h2>
            <p>The Faketour is a parody of <a onclick="$('#protour').toggle(200);">Magic: the Gathering's Protour</a>, where players
                create new Standard decks, and get to experience the new limited environment
                before the metagame has settled and the best decks and cards are well known.
                To this end, players must create their decks before any tournaments with 
                the new format have been held, whcih means that they have the two week span
                from when all of the cards from the new set are revealed until the set's official
                release, when the first tournament will be held.
            </p>
            <div style="display:none" name="protour" id="protour">
                <h2>The Protour</h2>
                <p>Every three months, a new Magic: the Gathering expansion is released, 
                    and to celebrate this, Wizard of the Coast holds a tournament where pros 
                    come together from all across the world to battle it with the brand new cards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Players compete in both draft and constructed, in an effort to crown the conclusive 
                    champion of the new set. The top performing players earn Pro Points, which gain them
                    <i>something</i>, I would assume.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h2>How does it work?</h2>
            <p>The Faketour consists of two portions, the first of which a Standard constructed tournament, where 
                players build cards incorporating cards from the newest set. The form of the other half can vary, but
                previous Faketours have included: </p>
                <li> Draft
                <li> Sealed
                <li> Frontier
                <li> Modern
                <li> Cube
            <p>
                The most frequently included format is draft, but whatever the choice, the purpose is always to highlight the 
                impact of the newly released set.
            </p>
            <p>
                Players play a three-round swiss tournament for each format, resulting in six rounds total. The best four 
                players collectively then play a single-elimination Standard tournament to crown the champion. Rounds in 
                the swiss portion are best-of-three, while games in the single single-elimination portion are best-of-five.
